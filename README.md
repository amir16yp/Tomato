# Tomato
experimental 2d video game engine in Java swing.
currently i have implemented:
- background tiles that form a level, tiles can be animated
- multiple levels that can be loaded from a file, a player can walk through certain tiles (i.e doors) to switch a level
- collision with solid tiles
- walking animations
- melee (zombie) enemies with ai
- start/pause menu gui
- shooting projectiles
- a dialogue box for interacting with things by pressing F
- healthbars for both enemies and the player (or any other entity i will add in the future)
